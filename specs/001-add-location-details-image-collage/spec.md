# Feature Specification: Location Details Image Collage

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-location-details-image-collage`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "Add an image collage component to the location details page. Replace the single image display (currently at line 100-108) with a dynamic image collage that shows multiple location photos. The collage should support 1-6 images with an adaptive grid layout: 1 image shows full width, 2 images show side-by-side, 3 images show a Pinterest-style masonry layout, 4+ images show a 2x2+ grid. Images should be clickable to open a lightbox/modal for full-screen viewing with navigation between images. The component must use Next.js Image component for optimization, maintain responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop, and preserve the existing alt text pattern for accessibility. Location entity should be extended to support multiple image URLs instead of just the hash-based single image."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a potential customer browsing location details, I want to see multiple photos of a location in an attractive collage layout so that I can better understand the space and make an informed booking decision. I want to click on any photo to view it full-screen and navigate through all images to explore the location thoroughly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a location with 1 image, **When** I view the location details page, **Then** I see a single full-width image
2. **Given** a location with 2 images, **When** I view the location details page, **Then** I see two images displayed side-by-side in equal proportions
3. **Given** a location with 3 images, **When** I view the location details page, **Then** I see images arranged in a Pinterest-style masonry layout
4. **Given** a location with 4 or more images, **When** I view the location details page, **Then** I see images arranged in a 2x2 or larger grid layout
5. **Given** I am viewing the collage, **When** I click on any image, **Then** a full-screen lightbox opens showing that image
6. **Given** the lightbox is open, **When** I navigate to next/previous, **Then** I can cycle through all location images
7. **Given** I am on mobile/tablet/desktop, **When** I view the collage, **Then** the layout adapts responsively to my screen size
8. **Given** any image in the collage, **When** screen readers parse the page, **Then** each image has descriptive alt text for accessibility

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a location has 0 images? System displays a placeholder image
- What happens when a location has more than 6 images? Collage displays all images with navigation arrows to browse through them
- How does system handle images that fail to load? System shows a global toast notification to inform the user
- What happens on very small mobile screens (< 375px width)?
- How does lightbox handle portrait vs landscape images with different aspect ratios?
