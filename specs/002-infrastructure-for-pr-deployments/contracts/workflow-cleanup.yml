# CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS

# Input Requirements:
# - Secrets: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
# - Pull Request: Must be in closed state (merged or not)

# Output Guarantees:
# - Container app revisions deactivated (frontend and backend)
# - Database cleanup initiated (may require manual completion)
# - Workflow completes successfully even if resources already deleted

# Error Handling:
# - Revision not found: Continues (idempotent, already cleaned)
# - Database deletion failure: Logs warning, continues (manual cleanup documented)
# - Azure login failure: Fails workflow (critical error)

# Behavioral Contracts:
# - FR-012: Automatic cleanup when PR merged
# - FR-013: Automatic cleanup when PR closed without merging
# - FR-014: Cleanup occurs for all container apps (frontend, backend)
# - FR-015: Cleanup is asynchronous (doesn't block PR close)

# Idempotency:
# - Safe to run multiple times for same PR
# - Uses continue-on-error to handle already-deleted resources
# - No side effects if resources don't exist

# Known Limitations:
# - Database cleanup may require manual intervention (PostgreSQL container doesn't expose public endpoint for psql)
# - Consider implementing database cleanup via Azure Container Jobs or manual process
