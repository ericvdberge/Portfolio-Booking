Quickly stages all changes and creates a local commit with an intelligent commit message. Perfect for rapid development iterations.

1. Analyze current git changes (staged and unstaged)
2. Generate a descriptive commit message based on the changes
3. Stage all changes and create the commit locally

Note: This command only creates local commits and does not push to remote origin. Use `git push` separately when ready to share changes.
