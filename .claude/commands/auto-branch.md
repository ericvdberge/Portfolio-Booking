Automatically creates a new local branch based on current changes with an intelligent name suggestion.

1. Analyze current git changes (staged and unstaged)
2. Generate a descriptive branch name based on the changes
3. Create and switch to the new branch locally
4. Stage changes for the new branch

The branch name will follow the pattern: `feature/description-of-changes` or `fix/description-of-changes` based on the nature of the modifications detected.

Note: This command only creates local branches and does not push to remote origin. Use `git push -u origin <branch-name>` separately when ready to share the branch.
