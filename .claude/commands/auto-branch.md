Automatically creates a new branch based on current changes with an intelligent name suggestion.

1. Analyze current git changes (staged and unstaged)
2. Generate a descriptive branch name based on the changes
3. Create and switch to the new branch
4. Optionally stage and commit the changes

The branch name will follow the pattern: `feature/description-of-changes` or `fix/description-of-changes` based on the nature of the modifications detected.
