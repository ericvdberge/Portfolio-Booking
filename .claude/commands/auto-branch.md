Automatically creates a new branch based on current changes with an intelligent name suggestion and pushes to remote.

1. Analyze current git changes (staged and unstaged)
2. Generate a descriptive branch name based on the changes
3. Create and switch to the new branch locally
4. Stage changes for the new branch
5. Push the new branch to remote origin with upstream tracking

The branch name will follow the pattern: `feature/description-of-changes` or `fix/description-of-changes` based on the nature of the modifications detected.
